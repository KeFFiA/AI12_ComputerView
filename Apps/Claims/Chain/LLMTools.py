Following damage being sustained by Vallair to the original installed Thrust Reverser (which is being handled as a separate claim), a replacement Thrust Reverser was procured by FlyPlay and shipped to Vallair for installation. During the installation process undertaken by Vallair employees, which involved the Thrust Reverser being lifted in a sling by crane, it came into contact with the No. 6 strut installed on engine No. 2. Preliminary inspections revealed impact deformation to the inner fixed structure, outside of allowable limitations for continued operation. After undertaking detailed damage mapping, the Thrust Reverser was repaired in accordance with the Structural Repair Manual (SRM) by Vallair. McLarens Paris office was able to undertake a survey at the Vallair facility and discuss the extent of the damage sustained and repairs undertaken.",
