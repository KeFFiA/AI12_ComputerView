As a result, blue water flooded the forward and aft cargo compartment, Electronic Equipment compartment and the passenger cabin. Detailed inspections revealed the presence of blue water around the Main Battery and the carpet in the passenger cabin was saturated. The Main Battery and passenger cabin carpet were replaced, and the aircraft was released to service. SCAT Airlines has formally placed JSC “Nursultan Nazarbaev International Airport” on notice.",

The aircraft was undergoing scheduled maintenance at the Vallair facility. Following damage being sustained by Vallair to the original installed Thrust Reverser (which is being handled as a separate claim), a replacement Thrust Reverser was procured by FlyPlay and shipped to Vallair for installation. During the installation process undertaken by Vallair employees, which involved the Thrust Reverser being lifted in a sling by crane, it came into contact with the No. 6 strut installed on engine No. 2. Preliminary inspections revealed impact deformation to the inner fixed structure, outside of allowable limitations for continued operation. After undertaking detailed damage mapping, the Thrust Reverser was repaired in accordance with the Structural Repair Manual (SRM) by Vallair. McLarens Paris office was able to undertake a survey at the Vallair facility and discuss the extent of the damage sustained and repairs undertaken.",

    "summary": "SCAT Airlines, Boeing 737-500, Registration UP-B3722, left wing lower panel deformation, Ḥa'il, Saudi Arabia, 19 July 2025. During post flight inspections, a wing lower panel holding Part Number 65-50821-763 was discovered with impact deformation, which most likely occurred due to material being thrown up by the wheels during the last take-off or landing. The panel was replaced, and the aircraft was released to service. Based on the information available to date, we anticipate that the incident related repairs will most likely be contained within the applicable Policy excess amount. As such, we see no reason to recommend that a Loss Reserve be established. We recommend a Fee Reserve in the amount of GBP3,000.00, inclusive of any applicable VAT.",
